# PhysicsSimulator
This is a website which uses p5.js to create simulations of certain things
 I used intellij and it did autocompleted. also I had AI halp me with collisions and simple Harmonic motions so dont mind if those are not up to standard also dont mind the variable naming i asked ai to clean up my code and i dont know what it did heh, sorry to any hack clubber if reviewing for that but I did the rest of it.

For the energy simulation make sure to press space not click i ddn't know how to fix it.
